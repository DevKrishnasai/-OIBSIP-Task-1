# -OIBSIP-Task-1 (Calculator)
---It is a simple application build using HTMl,CSS and JS---

HTML Structure: The HTML structure of the calculator includes all the buttons needed to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, percentage, etc.

Concepts Used: HTML tags and attributes, input elements, form elements.

CSS Styling: The CSS styling is used to make the calculator look attractive by adding different colors, gradients, shadows, and fonts. Media queries are also used to make the calculator responsive to different screen sizes.

Concepts Used: CSS selectors, properties, values, media queries.

JavaScript Functionality: The JavaScript code is used to perform the arithmetic operations based on the user input. For example, when the user clicks on the addition button, the JavaScript code reads the two operands entered by the user, calculates the result, and displays it on the screen.

Concepts Used: Variables, data types, operators, functions, conditional statements, loops, event handling, DOM manipulation, error handling.

Error Handling: The JavaScript code accounts for errors that may occur while performing the arithmetic operations. For instance, if the user tries to divide by zero, an error message is displayed on the screen instead of the incorrect result.

Concepts Used: try-catch blocks, if-else statements.

Testing: The calculator project is thoroughly tested to ensure that it works as intended and there are no errors or bugs.

Concepts Used: Debugging techniques, testing methodologies.

Overall, building a calculator project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves using a variety of programming concepts and techniques including HTML tags and attributes, CSS selectors and properties, JavaScript functions, conditional statements, loops, event handling, DOM manipulation, error handling, debugging, and testing methodologies.
